# Design Target

The main value of maptalks.three is to supplement the maptalks-gl ecosystem. Therefore, when your business needs can be solved with maptalks-gl, please use maptalks-gl. Only when the business requires custom graphics, etc., can we introduce maptalks.three



The functional requirements of regular buildings, administrative areas, roads, and point graphics can be fulfilled by maptalks-gl  

The Three plugin is designed for users with certain secondary development capabilities. Unlike Deck.gl, which requires users to configure parameters and styles, the Three plugin requires you to be familiar with Three
When and only when the gl plugin is unable to meet business requirements, use maptalks.three for effects such as the following, which have strong customization capabilities and are not available in the gl plugin
